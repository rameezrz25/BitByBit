### **Visitor Pattern: Adding New Operations Without Changing the Structure!** üß≥üåü

### **What is the Visitor Pattern?** ü§î

The **Visitor Pattern** is a **behavioral design pattern** that lets you **add new operations** to existing object structures  **without modifying those structures** . In other words, it lets you "visit" different elements of an object structure and perform operations on them without changing the classes of those elements. This is particularly useful when you have a **fixed object structure** but need to add new functionality frequently.

### **Real-World Analogy: A Tourist Guide** üó∫Ô∏è

Imagine you are a **tourist guide** visiting a museum:

* The museum has different  **sections** :  **art** ,  **history** ,  **science** , etc.
* As a  **tourist guide** , you don‚Äôt change the museum itself, but you perform different **operations** (like giving a tour or explaining exhibits) for each section.
* Each section of the museum is an  **element** , and the **tourist guide** is the **visitor** performing operations on those elements. The museum remains the same, but you can add new tours (operations) whenever needed.

In the  **Visitor Pattern** , the **elements** (museum sections) accept **visitors** (tourist guides) that perform operations on them without altering the structure of the museum (the classes).

### **Why Use the Visitor Pattern?** üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Add New Operations Easily** : You can add new operations (or behavior) without modifying the existing object structures.
2. **Avoid Polluting Classes** : It keeps the object classes clean and focused on their core responsibilities.
3. **Separation of Concerns** : It separates the operation logic from the object structure, making the code easier to maintain.
4. **Open for Extension** : You can easily extend the functionality of the object structure by adding new visitors without changing the original objects.

---

### **How Does It Work?** üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Element** : The object structure that we want to add operations to (e.g., museum sections).
2. **Visitor** : The class that performs the operation on the elements.
3. **ConcreteVisitor** : A specific implementation of the visitor that defines how to perform an operation on an element.
4. **Accept** : A method in the element that allows the visitor to visit it and perform the operation.

### **Visitor Pattern Structure** üèóÔ∏è

| **Role**            | **Description**                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Element**         | Defines an `accept`method that takes a visitor.                            |
| **ConcreteElement** | Implements the `accept`method, allowing the visitor to perform operations. |
| **Visitor**         | Declares a `visit`method for each concrete element class.                  |
| **ConcreteVisitor** | Implements the `visit`method for each concrete element.                    |
| **Client**          | Creates elements and visitors and manages the visiting process.              |

### **Example: Visitor Pattern in C++** üíª

#### **Scenario** : Calculating Areas of Different Shapes

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <memory>

// Element (Shape)
class Shape {
public:
    virtual ~Shape() = default;
    virtual void accept(class ShapeVisitor& visitor) = 0;  // Accept method for visitor
};

// Concrete Elements (Shapes)
class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    double radius;
    Circle(double r) : radius(r) {}

    void accept(ShapeVisitor& visitor) override;
};

class Rectangle : public Shape {
public:
    double width, height;
    Rectangle(double w, double h) : width(w), height(h) {}

    void accept(ShapeVisitor& visitor) override;
};

// Visitor
class ShapeVisitor {
public:
    virtual void visit(Circle& circle) = 0;
    virtual void visit(Rectangle& rectangle) = 0;
};

// Concrete Visitor: Calculate area
class AreaCalculator : public ShapeVisitor {
public:
    void visit(Circle& circle) override {
        double area = 3.14159 * circle.radius * circle.radius;
        std::cout << "Area of Circle: " << area << "\n";
    }

    void visit(Rectangle& rectangle) override {
        double area = rectangle.width * rectangle.height;
        std::cout << "Area of Rectangle: " << area << "\n";
    }
};

// Accept method implementations
void Circle::accept(ShapeVisitor& visitor) {
    visitor.visit(*this);
}

void Rectangle::accept(ShapeVisitor& visitor) {
    visitor.visit(*this);
}

// Client Code
int main() {
    std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Shape>> shapes;
    shapes.push_back(std::make_shared<Circle>(5.0));
    shapes.push_back(std::make_shared<Rectangle>(4.0, 6.0));

    AreaCalculator areaCalc;
  
    for (auto& shape : shapes) {
        shape->accept(areaCalc);  // Visitor visits each shape
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### **Example: Visitor Pattern in Python** üêç

#### **Scenario** : Handling Different Employee Roles

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Employee(ABC):
    """Element"""
    @abstractmethod
    def accept(self, visitor):
        pass

class Developer(Employee):
    """Concrete Element"""
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def accept(self, visitor):
        visitor.visit(self)

class Manager(Employee):
    """Concrete Element"""
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def accept(self, visitor):
        visitor.visit(self)

class Visitor(ABC):
    """Visitor"""
    @abstractmethod
    def visit(self, developer):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def visit(self, manager):
        pass

class SalaryCalculator(Visitor):
    """Concrete Visitor"""
    def visit(self, developer):
        print(f"Calculating salary for developer {developer.name}")

    def visit(self, manager):
        print(f"Calculating salary for manager {manager.name}")

# Client Code
dev = Developer("John")
mgr = Manager("Alice")

salary_calculator = SalaryCalculator()

dev.accept(salary_calculator)  # Visitor calculates salary for developer
mgr.accept(salary_calculator)  # Visitor calculates salary for manager
```

### **Advantages** ‚úÖ

1. **Separation of Operations and Objects** : You can add new operations without modifying the object structure.
2. **Open for Extension** : New functionality can be added without changing existing code.
3. **Cleaner Code** : Keeps the classes simple and focused on their core functionality, while operations are handled by visitors.
4. **Centralized Behavior** : Centralizes operations, making it easier to manage complex business logic.

---

### **Disadvantages** ‚ùå

1. **Complexity** : It can introduce additional complexity, especially with many elements and visitors.
2. **Hard to Maintain** : As the number of elements increases, the visitor interface may grow large and become difficult to manage.
3. **Tight Coupling** : Elements need to know about the visitor, which can lead to tight coupling between them.

### **When to Use the Visitor Pattern?** üìå

* When you need to **perform operations** on **elements** of an object structure (e.g., shapes, components) but don‚Äôt want to modify those elements.
* When the object structure is  **stable** , but you frequently need to add new operations.
* When you have a **hierarchical object structure** (like a tree or composite) and you need to apply different actions across the elements.
* When you want to **separate operations** from object classes to keep them clean and focused on their primary responsibilities.

The **Visitor Pattern** is perfect when you need to **add functionality** to an **object structure** without modifying it, allowing you to keep your code **clean** and  **flexible** . Think of it like sending a **visitor** to perform tasks across different **areas** without rearranging anything! üß≥üåç
