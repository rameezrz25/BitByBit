# üåü **Object-Oriented Design (OOD): A Beginner‚Äôs Guide** üåü

**Object-Oriented Design (OOD)** is the process of planning a system of **interacting objects** to solve a software problem. It involves creating classes, defining their relationships, and designing how they will work together.

---

### üü¢ **What is OOD?**

OOD is about breaking down a problem into smaller components (objects) and designing how they will interact.

Key aspects include:

* **Identifying key objects** in the system.
* **Defining their attributes and behaviors** (methods).
* Establishing relationships between objects.

---

### üîë **Why Use OOD?**

1. **Real-world Modeling:** Maps real-world entities into code.
2. **Reusability:** Promotes reusable and modular code.
3. **Maintainability:** Easier to debug, test, and enhance.
4. **Scalability:** Flexible structure for adding new features.

---

### üéØ **Key Concepts of OOD**

#### 1. **Classes and Objects**

* **Class:** Blueprint for creating objects.

  Example: A "Car" class defines the structure of cars.
* **Object:** An instance of a class.

  Example: A "Tesla Model S" object is created from the "Car" class.

---

#### 2. **Four Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

1. **Encapsulation**

   > Bundle data and methods that operate on the data into one unit.
   >

   **Example:**

   ```cpp
   class BankAccount {
   private:
       double balance;
   public:
       void deposit(double amount) { balance += amount; }
       double getBalance() const { return balance; }
   };
   ```
2. **Abstraction**

   > Hide unnecessary details; show only the essentials.
   >

   **Example:** You drive a car using the steering wheel, not by controlling the engine directly.
3. **Inheritance**

   > Create a new class based on an existing class.
   >

   **Example:**

   ```cpp
   class Vehicle {
       void start() { /* Start logic */ }
   };
   class Car : public Vehicle {
       void openSunroof() { /* Sunroof logic */ }
   };
   ```
4. **Polymorphism**

   > One interface, many implementations.
   >

   **Example:**

   ```cpp
   class Shape {
   public:
       virtual void draw() = 0; // Pure virtual function
   };
   class Circle : public Shape {
       void draw() override { cout << "Drawing Circle"; }
   };
   class Square : public Shape {
       void draw() override { cout << "Drawing Square"; }
   };
   ```

### üìã **Steps to Approach OOD**

1. **Understand Requirements:**
   * Analyze functional and non-functional needs.
2. **Identify Objects:**
   * Find entities that can be represented as objects.

     Example: For an  **e-commerce system** , objects could be `Product`, `Customer`, `Order`.
3. **Define Class Structure:**
   * For each object, decide:
     * **Attributes:** Properties of the object (e.g., `name`, `price`).
     * **Methods:** Actions the object can perform (e.g., `addToCart()`).
4. **Establish Relationships:**
   * Model interactions between objects:
     * **Inheritance** (is-a relationship).
     * **Composition** (has-a relationship).
5. **Use Design Patterns (if needed):**
   * Apply proven solutions like Singleton, Factory, etc.
6. **Refactor Iteratively:**
   * Simplify and improve design as requirements evolve.

### üíª **Example: Designing a Library Management System**

#### üìã **Requirements:**

1. Users can borrow books.
2. Librarians can add/remove books.
3. Books have a title, author, and genre.

#### üñºÔ∏è **Class Diagram:**

```
+-------------------+         +-------------------+
|       Book        |<>------>|     Member        |
+-------------------+         +-------------------+
| title             |         | name             |
| author            |         | id               |
| genre             |         +-------------------+
+-------------------+         | borrowBook()      |
                              | returnBook()      |
                              +-------------------+

+-------------------+
|   Librarian       |
+-------------------+
| addBook()         |
| removeBook()      |
+-------------------+
```

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Code Design:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Book {
public:
    string title, author, genre;

    Book(string t, string a, string g) : title(t), author(a), genre(g) {}
};

class Member {
private:
    string name;
    int id;
    vector<Book> borrowedBooks;

public:
    Member(string n, int i) : name(n), id(i) {}

    void borrowBook(Book& book) {
        borrowedBooks.push_back(book);
        cout << name << " borrowed " << book.title << endl;
    }

    void returnBook(Book& book) {
        cout << name << " returned " << book.title << endl;
    }
};

class Librarian {
public:
    void addBook(vector<Book>& catalog, Book book) {
        catalog.push_back(book);
        cout << "Added book: " << book.title << endl;
    }

    void removeBook(vector<Book>& catalog, string title) {
        catalog.erase(remove_if(catalog.begin(), catalog.end(),
                                [&title](Book& b) { return b.title == title; }),
                      catalog.end());
        cout << "Removed book: " << title << endl;
    }
};
```

### üîç **Common Mistakes in OOD**

1. **Overengineering:** Avoid unnecessary abstractions or overly complex designs.
2. **Tight Coupling:** Ensure classes aren‚Äôt overly dependent on each other.
3. **Ignoring Reusability:** Design classes with future reuse in mind.

---

### üåü **Tips for Effective OOD**

1. **Keep it Simple:** Follow the  **KISS Principle** ‚Äîdon‚Äôt overcomplicate.
2. **Follow SOLID Principles:** For clean and maintainable designs.
3. **Think in Objects:** Focus on the problem, not the syntax.
4. **Iterate Often:** Designs evolve; refactor as requirements change.
5. **Use UML Diagrams:** They make complex relationships easy to understand.
