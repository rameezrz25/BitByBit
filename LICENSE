                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) <year>  <your name or organization>
Copyright holders: <name(s) of copyright holders>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other
written material are designed to take away your freedom to share and
change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended
to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program
— to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free
Software Foundation, use the GPL for most of our software; it applies also
to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
To understand the concept, you should think of "free" as in "free speech,"
not as in "free beer".  

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these
rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have to
accept that you must also include a copy of this GPL license along with
your software, and you must make any modified versions also be free.

                           TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  “The Program” refers to any work of authorship licensed under this
  License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”.

  “The Modified Program” refers to any work that is based on the Program
  or on the work being combined with it. It can include translations, or
  modifications to make it run on different platforms. The term “Program”
  can be used to refer to either the original program or any modified
  version.

  1. Source Code.

  The source code for a program is the preferred form of the work for making
  modifications to it. For an executable, complete source code includes
  source code for all modules it contains, and for a library, complete
  source code includes the source code for all modules it uses.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  You can copy, modify, and distribute the Program, as long as you comply with
  the conditions of this License. You can even use the Program in proprietary
  applications, but if you make changes to the Program, you have to make the
  modified version available under this License.

  3. Copyleft.

  The modified Program must also be licensed under this License. The terms
  “modified Program” and “Program” include any derivative work based on the
  original Program.

  4. Distribution.

  When distributing the Program or any modified versions, you must make sure
  the program is accompanied by a copy of the GPL-3.0 License, as well as
  providing access to the source code of your modifications.

  5. No Warranty.

  There is no warranty for this software. It is distributed “as-is”,
  and the author(s) or copyright holder(s) are not liable for any damage
  or issues arising from its use.

  6. Termination.

  If you violate the terms of the GPL, your rights under this License will
  automatically terminate, but you may be reinstated if the violation is cured
  within 30 days of notice.
