### **What Are CISC and RISC?**

* **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)** :
* A type of processor architecture with **complex instructions** that can perform multiple operations in a single command.
* Focused on reducing the number of instructions per program, even if individual instructions take longer to execute.
* **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)** :
* A processor architecture with **simple and uniform instructions** that execute in a single clock cycle.
* Prioritizes faster execution of instructions over reducing the total number of instructions.
