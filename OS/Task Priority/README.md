### **Task Priority Scheduling Algorithms** üïí‚ú®

Task Priority Scheduling is a method used in operating systems and real-time environments to schedule tasks based on their priority. Higher-priority tasks are executed first, ensuring critical operations are completed on time. Let's explore how these algorithms work!

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Priority** :

* Each task is assigned a priority level.
* Higher-priority tasks preempt lower-priority tasks.

1. **Preemptive vs. Non-Preemptive** :

* **Preemptive** : Higher-priority tasks can interrupt running lower-priority tasks.
* **Non-Preemptive** : Once a task starts, it cannot be interrupted until it completes.

1. **Starvation** :

* Low-priority tasks may never execute if higher-priority tasks keep arriving.

1. **Aging** :

* A mechanism to increase the priority of waiting tasks to prevent starvation.

### **Task Priority Scheduling Algorithms**

#### 1. **Static Priority Scheduling** üõ†Ô∏è

* Priorities are assigned during task creation and remain fixed.
* Common in simple systems.

 **Example** :

* Tasks: {T1, T2, T3} with priorities {High, Medium, Low}.
* Execution order: T1 ‚Üí T2 ‚Üí T3.

 **Advantages** :

* Easy to implement.
* Predictable execution order.

 **Disadvantages** :

* Cannot adapt to changing system needs.
* Risk of starvation for low-priority tasks.

---

#### 2. **Dynamic Priority Scheduling** üîÑ

* Priorities change based on task behavior, deadlines, or system state.

 **Example: Earliest Deadline First (EDF)** :

* Tasks are scheduled based on their deadlines.
* The task with the earliest deadline is executed first.

 **Advantages** :

* Flexible and adaptive.
* Efficient for real-time systems.

 **Disadvantages** :

* Complex to implement.
* May require frequent recalculations of priorities.

---

#### 3. **Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)** üìä

* Used in periodic tasks.
* Tasks with shorter periods are assigned higher priorities.

 **Example** :

* Task T1 (period = 2ms), T2 (period = 5ms), T3 (period = 10ms).
* Execution order: T1 ‚Üí T2 ‚Üí T3 based on period lengths.

 **Advantages** :

* Optimal for fixed-priority periodic tasks.
* Simple and predictable.

 **Disadvantages** :

* Cannot handle sporadic tasks well.
* May lead to underutilization if tasks are not periodic.

---

#### 4. **Priority Inversion** üîÑ

* A problem where a higher-priority task waits for a lower-priority task that holds a needed resource.

 **Solution** :  **Priority Inheritance** :

* Temporarily boost the priority of the lower-priority task holding the resource.

 **Example** :

* T1 (High), T2 (Medium), T3 (Low) share a resource.
* If T3 holds the resource, it temporarily gets T1's priority to complete quickly.

### **Real-Life Analogy** üåü

* Imagine a  **hospital emergency room** :
  * **High-priority patients** (critical) are treated first.
  * **Medium-priority patients** (urgent but not critical) wait if critical cases arrive.
  * **Low-priority patients** (routine check-ups) wait the longest.

### **Implementation Example: Preemptive Priority Scheduling**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

struct Task {
    string name;
    int priority;
    int burstTime;
};

bool comparePriority(Task a, Task b) {
    return a.priority > b.priority; // Higher priority first
}

void scheduleTasks(vector<Task> tasks) {
    sort(tasks.begin(), tasks.end(), comparePriority);
    cout << "Execution Order:\n";
    for (auto task : tasks) {
        cout << task.name << " (Priority: " << task.priority << ", Burst Time: " << task.burstTime << ")\n";
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<Task> tasks = {
        {"Task1", 3, 10},
        {"Task2", 1, 5},
        {"Task3", 2, 8}
    };
    scheduleTasks(tasks);
    return 0;
}
```

 **Output** :

```
Execution Order:
Task1 (Priority: 3, Burst Time: 10)
Task3 (Priority: 2, Burst Time: 8)
Task2 (Priority: 1, Burst Time: 5)
```

### **Advantages of Task Priority Scheduling**

1. Ensures critical tasks are executed first.
2. Effective for time-sensitive applications.
3. Improves system responsiveness for high-priority tasks.

---

### **Disadvantages**

1. Low-priority tasks may starve.
2. Requires careful priority assignment to avoid bottlenecks.
3. Can become complex with dynamic or changing priorities.

### **Applications** üöÄ

* **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)** : Ensuring deadlines are met in embedded systems.
* **Multimedia Processing** : Giving priority to time-critical audio and video tasks.
* **Cloud Computing** : Assigning resources based on task importance.
* **Game Development** : Prioritizing rendering over background logic.

### **Conclusion** üéØ

Task Priority Scheduling is a powerful and flexible way to manage task execution. By balancing priorities effectively and addressing issues like starvation and inversion, it ensures systems perform optimally in a variety of environments!
